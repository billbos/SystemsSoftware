Functionality
The program opens several files and checks the occurrences of a string pattern in each file. It does this by creating a process for each file to check them simultaneously. Each process saves the result in a file which afterwards are opened by the main process. The main process adds up all results and prints the solution.

Input parameters
This program needs at least two input parameters
- The first parameter is the pattern ("pattern") which can be a string or a regex pattern
- The other parameters are the filenames ("filename.txt") which provide the text to search for the pattern

Output
Number of occurrences of the chosen pattern in the chosen files

Possible error occurrences
- creation of new child processes failed ("Error on fork()")
- termination of execl failed (“Error: execl failed")
- child termination failed(“Error on child termination")
- open result-files failed(“Error: could not open file")
