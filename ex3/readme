Functionality
The program opens a matrix (a .txt file) which represents a grayscaled image. It then fixed the pixels with wrong values by replaceing the value of every pixel with the median of the values of its surrounding pixels.

Input parameters
This program needs four input parameters
- A string corresponding to the full path of the file containing the input image
- An integer corresponding to the window size
- An integer corresponding to the number of threads to be created
- An integer that controls whether to run the serial (0) or the parallel (1) version

Output
A matrix (filtered.txt) which contains the corrected values
