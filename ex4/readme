Functionality
The program takes multiple grayscale images (represented by intensity values in a matrix) and fixes the wrong pixels according to a user-selected approach (mode 0-2). It is also able to benchmark this three approaches (mode 3).

Input parameters
This program needs following input parameters
- An integer corresponding to the window size
- An integer corresponding to the number of threads to be created
- An integer that controls which run mode to execute (0-3)
- A list of strings corresponding to the filenames of the input image matrices

Output
Multiple matrices (OUT_imagename.txt) with the corrected values
